    This application leads you through a series of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upon completion your answers will be saved to our servers using your secret PIN code.
    </p>
    <p>
    You should complete the survey in one sitting. It is OK if you get interrupted briefly
    (e.g. a phone call) but delaying completion too long means you will have to start over
    from the beginning.    
    </p>
    <p>
    When you are ready to submit your answers your phone will need to have an active
    Internet connection.
