        <CONTENT>38-year-old left-hander Mark Mulder will not be attempting another comeback this tear, according to Jerry Crasnick of ESPN and Baseball America. Mulder tried to return from a lengthy hiatus last year, but a comeback bid ended with a spring training injury in Angels camp last year. "I just couldn't get where I needed to be," Mulder said. Mulder went 103-60 with a 4.18 ERA in nine years in the majors. He hasn't pitched in an MLB game since 2008.
